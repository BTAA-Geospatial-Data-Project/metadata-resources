Census block groups are not legal boundaries, but are considered stable geographic units used for the presentation of decennial census data. The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named \"TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau): \"Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, …., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to Block Group 3. As with block groups delineated for Census 2000, block groups delineated for 5-38 the 2010 Census generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Most block groups were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau\'s Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant. \"A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one block group and block groups are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas. \"Block groups have a valid range of 0 through 9. Block groups beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census trac boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and block group of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Because of updates since 2000, there are 0 block groups that now contain land.\""|"http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Demographics/Census_Blockgroups_2011.zip"|"http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/Census_Blockgroups_2011/MapServer/0"|"http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html?category=Census"|""|""|

The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts. \"The 2014 TIGER/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary, and unified school districts. The 2014 shapefiles contain information from the 2013-2014 school year.

The unified school districts are districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists (see exceptions described below), and where there is an elementary school district the secondary school district may or may not exist (see explanation below). \"The U.S. Census Bureau\'s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program provides annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs. \"The SAIPE program produces the following county and state estimates: Total number of people in poverty.

These data, which are estimates produced under the Census Bureau\'s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, were then incorporated into a preexisting shapefile showing school districts in Indiana, as of 2000. Data that were obtained for each school district included total population of each district, population of relevant children (ages 5 to 17), and number of children from families in poverty. A new field, giving the percentage of children in each district that are from families in poverty, was calculated by dividing the number of children in poverty by the population of relevant children. The SAIPE data were produced for school districts as they existed in 2005-2006. It was not possible to find a boundary file for school districts in those years, so a boundary file for 2000 was used. In a few areas, it was not possible to match the SAIPE data with the 2000 school-district boundaries. This is presumably the result of changes (such as mergers or divisions) of school districts between 2000 and 2006. Regarding the preexisting shapefile showing school districts, the following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html): \"School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational services for the area\'s residents.

The 2011 shapefiles contain information from the 2009-2010 school year. The 2009-2010 school districts represent districts in operation as of January 1, 2010. \"The elementary school districts provide education to the lower grade/age levels and the secondary school districts provide education to the upper grade/age levels. The unified school districts are districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists (see exceptions described below), and where there is an elementary school district the secondary school district may or may not exist (see explanation below). \"The U.S. Census Bureau\'s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program provides annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs. \"The SAIPE program produces the following county and state estimates: Total number of people in poverty. Number of childer under age 5 in poevery (for states only). •number of related children ages 5 to 17 in families in poverty. Number of children under age 18 in poverty.
