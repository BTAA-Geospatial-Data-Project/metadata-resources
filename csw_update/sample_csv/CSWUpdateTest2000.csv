These reports included maps showing elevation of the Danville Coal Member (Dugger Formation, Pennsylvanian). The elevation maps were based on coal-test records and interpretations of geophysical logs that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey. Data points were plotted by coal geologists of the Indiana Geological Survey and elevation contours were drawn by hand. The original work maps were compiled at a scale of 0.5 inch = 1 mile (scale, 1:126,720). Following completion of the investigations, the work maps showing elevation contours were subsequently scanned and digitized, and the resulting county coverages were then compiled into a single multicounty coverage. Elevations are given in feet, and the contour interval is 20 feet. Since the completion of this shapefile, additional data on coalbed elevations in selected areas has been obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey; interested users may wish to contact the Indiana Geological Survey for information on these more up-to-date sources.","Indiana Geological Survey###Denver Harper","Indiana Geological Survey","geoscientificInformation","http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Geology/Coal_Elevation_Danville.zip###http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geology/Coal_Elevation_Danville/MapServer/export","","","","","","",

After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CDs in the state as practicable. The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999. The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained in effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the ""1998 Congressional Plan A"" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997 plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. The Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" (reflected in the 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections.

In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.

This dataset is currently incomplete but includes data for the following twenty-nine HUC08 subbasins in Indiana: Auglaize (0410007), Blue-Sinking (05140104), Driftwood (05120204), Eel (05120104), Eel (05120203), Flatrock-Haw (05120205), Iroquois (07120002), Lower East Fork White (05120208), Lower Great Miami (05080002), Lower Ohio-Little Pigeon (05140201), Lower Wabash (05120113), Lower White (05120202), Middle Wabash-Busseron (05120111), Middle Wabash-Deer (05120105), Mississinewa (05120103), Muscatatuck (05120207), Patoka (05120209), Salamonie (05120102), St. Joseph (04050001), St. Joseph-Maumee (04100003), St. Marys (04100004), Sugar (05120110), Upper East Fork White (05120206), Upper Great Miami (05080001), Upper Maumee (04100005), Upper White (05120201), Vermillion (05120109), Whitewater (05080003), Wildcat (05120107). The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named ""NHD_LOCALRES_AREA_IN"": ""This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico.

The listing was published in the Indiana Register on March 1 of that year as Information Bulletin #4 in Volume 16, Number 6, page 1677 through 1680 (sometimes cited as 16 IR 1677). The listing has also been specifically incorporated by reference into statutes and rules. Notably, the listing is referenced in the standards for utility line crossings within floodways, formerly governed by IC 14-28-2 and now controlled by 310 IAC 6-1-16 through 310 IAC 6-1-18. See, also, the general permit for logjam removals, implemented as an emergency rule and pending for adoption as a permanent rule at 310 IAC 6-1-20. Except where incorporated into a statute or rule, the listing is intended to provide guidance rather than to have regulatory application. A special listing was prepared by the division of outdoor recreation of the department of natural resources. The listing is a corrected and condensed version of a listing complied by American Rivers and dated October 1990.

The file was created using 1:100,000 scale data from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), therefore, the lines remain in the NHD reaches, resulting in multiple line segments for each NRI listing. The line segments have NOT been dissolved. The start and end point of each listing segment is approximate and located by described landmarks. The following excerpt from the NPS, NRI website describes the eligibility for a river to be listed- In order to be listed on the NRI, a river must be free-flowing and possess one or more Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs). Thus, the eligibility analysis consists of an examination of the river's hydrology, including any man-made alterations, and an inventory of its natural, cultural, and recreational resources. There are a variety of methods to determine whether certain resources are so unique, rare or exemplary as to make them outstandingly remarkable. The determination that a river area contains ORVs is a professional judgment on the part of the interdisciplinary study team (IDT), based on objective, scientific analysis. Input from organizations and individuals familiar with specific river resources should be sought and documented as part of the process. In order to be assessed as outstandingly remarkable, a river-related value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a comparative regional or national scale. Dictionary definitions of the words ""unique"" and ""rare"" indicate that such a value would be one that is conspicuous example from among a number of similar values that are themselves uncommon or extraordinary. Only one such value is needed for eligibility.","Bernardin, Lochmueller & Associates, Inc.

Points represent monitoring stations attributed as occuring within the state of Indiana or along the Ohio River in Kentucky, or in Illinois along Lake Michigan. Joinable tables must be utilized to access data at specific stations for specific parameters. Five tables are available - tissue residue data (tischem.dbf), sediment chemistry data (sedichem.dbf), screening value, cancer slope factors, and noncancer reference doses for chemicals (reftabl.dbf), watershed summary data (watersh.dbf), biotoxicity data (biotox.dbf). US Environmental Protection Agency BASINS metadata reports - ""This dataset describes the accumulation of chemical contaminants in river, lake, ocean, and estuary bottoms and includes a screening assessment of the potential for associated adverse effects on human and environmental health. EPA evaluated more than 21,000 sampling stations nationwide using sediment chemistry data, chemical residue levels in edible tissue of aquatic organisms, and sediment toxicity data. Of the sampling stations evaluated, 5,521 stations were classified as Tier 1 (associated adverse effects are probable), 10,401 stations were classified as Tier 2 (associated adverse effects are possible, but expected infrequently), and 5,174 stations were classified as Tier 3 (no indication of associated adverse effects). Ninety-six watersheds were identified as areas of probable concern for sediment contamination. EPA believes that these watersheds represent the highest priority for further ecotoxicological assessments, risk analysis, temporal and spatial trend assessments, contaminant source evaluation, and management action because of the preponderance of evidence in these areas (although further evaluation is necessary). Also see the related report entitled The Incidence And Severity Of Sediment Contamination In Surface Waters of the United States, Volume 1, National Sediment Quality Survey (EPA 823-R-97-006, ) that was published in September 1997. For distribution with BASINS v.2.0, the spatial attributes of the database were prepared in Arcview shape file format while selected relational attributes were prepared in Arcview DBF file format.""

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named ""NHD_LOCALRES_WATERBODY_IN"": ""This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.""","U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Data author)###Indiana Department of Natural Resources (Data provider)###Chris Dintaman (Data processor)###Indiana Geographic Information Office (Data provider)###Indiana Geological Survey (Data processor)","United States Geological Survey","environment###inlandWaters###reservoir###United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)###playa###United States Geological Survey (USGS)###Indiana Geographic Information Office###Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###pond###water###swamp###National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)###hydrography###HUC08 subbasin###seep###ditch###waterbody###Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)###hydrology###lake###spring###canal###marsh###local resolution (1:2,400)###artificial path","http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes.zip","Tippecanoe County###Pulaski County###Sullivan County###Kosciusko County###Allen County###LaPorte County###Michigan###Marshall County###Daviess County###Howard County###DeKalb County###Scott County###Lake County###Posey County###Bartholomew County###Dubois County###Pike County###Orange County###Tipton County###Morgan County###Elkhart County###Porter County###Grant County###Floyd County###Adams County###Brown County###Fayette County###Putnam County###Newton County###Hendricks County###Monroe County###Fulton County###Clay County###Henry County###Madison County###Carroll County###Spencer County###Martin County###Owen County###Ohio###Starke County###Washington County###Gibson County###Shelby County###Crawford County###Noble County###Cass County###Boone County###Vermillion County###Switzerland County###Jay County###Benton County###Fountain County###St Joseph County###Ripley County###Warren County###Lagrange County###Decatur County###Rush County###Hamilton County###White County###Kentucky###Jennings County###Vanderburgh County###Greene County###Union County###Jackson County###Wabash County###Franklin County###Marion County###Perry County###Clinton County###Randolph County###Montgomery County###Wayne County###Indiana###Illinois###Warrick County###Harrison County###Lawrence County###Steuben County###Miami County###Parke County###Wells County###Clark County###Blackford County###Delaware County###Johnson County###Jefferson County###Hancock County###Knox County###Ohio County###Huntington County###Whitley County###Vigo County###Dearborn County###Jasper County","","","","","",

The goal of this project was to use an objective, reproducible methodology to estimate groundwater recharge rates in both glaciated and driftless environments. This groundwater-recharge raster layer was developed by combining a multiple regression analysis of groundwater recharge with characteristics of near-surface geologic materials. The groundwater recharge data used in the multiple regression analysis was derived from calculations of groundwater baseflow and surface-water runoff for 279 streams in Indiana. Estimates of groundwater base flow were determined using hydrograph separation analysis (Institute of Hydrology, 1980) determined using a local-minimums approach with a recession slope test, and were converted to recharge by multiplying by using estimates of runoff following Wolock (2003). The baseflow index (BFI) provides the proportion of runoff that is assumed to be groundwater contribution, so recharge was estimated as BFI * interpolated statewide runoff (not runoff per basin). The average annual rate of groundwater recharge (in/year) was used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis using ordinary least squares with several landscape and morphometric independent variables representing geologic, terrain, climate, and hydrogeologic characteristics. The regression model developed for Indiana had a global R2 value of 0.50, and the most influential variables at the 95% confidence level were: - Cumulative percent area of upstream impervious surfaces - Surface clay thickness - Percent of clay in soil - Average annual air temperature - Presence/absence of unconsolidated aquifers - Slope of ground surface - Cumulative percent area of upstream water bodies - Sand composition of water well boreholes - Cumulative percent area of upstream medium-height vegetation - Hydrologic group classification of soil (A,B,C,D - SSURGO) The regression model was used as a mapping tool to spatially distribute estimates of recharge across Indiana, incorporating details of the important landscape variables.","Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###Center for Geospatial Data Analysis (CGDA)###Sally L.

The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom. ""HSIP Gold: Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database.

These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as disclosure in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data. ""HSIP Freedom: NGAs goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach  HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit. ""The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the ""License Free HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA.

This is the publication guideline for cadastral data that is intended to provide a common format and structure and content for cadastral information that can be made available across jurisdictional boundaries, providing a consistent and uniform cadastral data to meet business need that includes connections to the source information from the data stewards. The data stewards determine which data are published and should be contacted for any questions on data content or for additional information. The cadastral publication data is data provided by cadastral data producers in a standard form on a regular basis. Cadastral publication data has two primary components, land parcel data and cadastral reference data. It is important to recognize that the publication data are not the same as the operation and maintenance or production data. The production data is structured to optimize maintenance processes, is integrated with internal agency operations and contains much more detail than the publication data.

This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census. The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs): ""ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPSs ZIP Code delivery areas.  ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another."" For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP: ""The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.""","United States Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau (creator)###Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping (processor)","Indiana Department of Transportation, Business Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping","Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)###TIGER/Line Identification Number (TLID)###ZIP Code###vector###geographic information system (GIS)###ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)###TIGER/Line###United States Department of Commerce###polygon###TIGER###United States Census Bureau (USCB)###society###boundaries","http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Reference/Zip_Codes_USCB.zip","Vermillion County###Steuben County###Kosciusko County###Marshall County###Tipton County###Greene County###Huntington County###Orange County###Miami County###Franklin County###Ripley County###Warren County###Rush County###Cass County###Benton County###Newton County###LaPorte County###Lawrence County###Randolph County###Martin County###Madison County###Floyd County###Lagrange County###Blackford County###Dearborn County###Switzerland County###Knox County###Hamilton County###Union County###Wayne County###Dekalb County###Adams County###Wabash County###Monroe County###Gibson County###Marion County###Daviess County###Elkhart County###Warrick County###Grant County###Jennings County###Clay County###Vanderburgh County###Harrison County###Decatur County###Vigo County###Washington County###Lake County###Owen County###Whitley County###Bartholomew County###Putnam County###Clinton County###Carroll County###Howard County###Sullivan County###Wells County###Parke County###Porter County###Hendricks County###Fountain County###Morgan County###Spencer County###Starke County###St Joseph County###Perry County###Jay County###Fayette County###Fulton County###Ohio County###Allen County###Posey County###Jackson County###Crawford County###Tippecanoe County###Indiana###Hancock County###Boone County###Pulaski County###Montgomery County###Shelby County###Henry County###Johnson County###Jefferson County###White County###Clark County###Scott County###Delaware County###Dubois County###Pike County###Jasper County###Brown County###Noble County","","","","","",

These data, which are estimates produced under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, were then incorporated into a preexisting shapefile showing school districts in Indiana, as of 2000. Data that were obtained for each school district included total population of each district, population of relevant children (ages 5 to 17), and number of children from families in poverty. A new field, giving the percentage of children in each district that are from families in poverty, was calculated by dividing the number of children in poverty by the population of relevant children. The SAIPE data were produced for school districts as they existed in 2005-2006. It was not possible to find a boundary file for school districts in those years, so a boundary file for 2000 was used. In a few areas, it was not possible to match the SAIPE data with the 2000 school-district boundaries. This is presumably the result of changes (such as mergers or divisions) of school districts between 2000 and 2006. Regarding the preexisting shapefile showing school districts, the following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html): ""School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents.

This grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2006) data set. There are 15 categories of land use shown in this data set when the associated layer file (LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded. The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006: ""The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness. Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks: 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table. In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued. Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products. These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release. A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products. NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones. NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered ""provisional"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.

These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies, involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of reference sites. Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar. The most immediate needs are to develope regional biological criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint source pollution. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995). These phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical level. Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme has been adopted for this effort. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent is subdivided into 32 classes. Level III is the hierarchical level shown on this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further subdivided to level IV. The applications of the ecoregions are explained in Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and regional projects. For additional information, contact James M.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and . ""The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edgematching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states in the mid-Atlantic region, including the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC), Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.""","United States Geological Survey (USGS) (Author)###Indiana Geological Survey (Digital compiler)","Indiana Geological Survey","imageryBaseMapsEarthCover###environment###cartography###United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)###geographic information system (GIS)###raster###land cover###grid###ESRI grid###raster grid###Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium###land use###National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2001)###managed land###Landsat###United States Geological Survey (USGS)###Indiana Geological Survey (IGS)","http://maps.indiana.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Environment/Land_Cover_2001/MapServer/export###http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Environment/Land_Cover_2001.zip","Vermillion County###Benton County###Kosciusko County###Jennings County###White County###Union County###Posey County###Whitley County###Franklin County###Greene County###Pike County###Wayne County###Morgan County###Jay County###Monroe County###Bartholomew County###Lagrange County###Indiana###Montgomery County###Ripley County###Howard County###Pulaski County###Shelby County###Warren County###Decatur County###Spencer County###Rush County###Hancock County###Martin County###Warrick County###Steuben County###Hamilton County###Gibson County###Vigo County###Owen County###St Joseph County###Knox County###Miami County###Clark County###Dearborn County###Allen County###Marion County###Johnson County###Huntington County###Adams County###Randolph County###Ohio County###Cass County###Tippecanoe County###Fulton County###Elkhart County###Jasper County###Switzerland County###Sullivan County###Wabash County###Orange County###Daviess County###Putnam County###Marshall County###Clinton County###Delaware County###Jefferson County###Scott County###Carroll County###LaPorte County###Porter County###Hendricks County###Floyd County###Vanderburgh County###Henry County###Brown County###Newton County###Dekalb County###Tipton County###Fountain County###Blackford County###Clay County###Perry County###Madison County###Washington County###Jackson County###Lake County###Harrison County###Starke County###Dubois County###Boone County###Noble County###Crawford County###Lawrence County###Wells County###Fayette County###Parke County###Grant County","","","","","",

As our undeveloped land continues to disappear, we recognize the need to redevelop and reuse land that may have viable buildings and infrastructure already present. The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation resources can lower the costs to a potential developer. Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight. Because the potential environmental liability at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup costs. Thus, the properties remain idle.

This shapefile represents the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials throughout Indiana. The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column. Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5): A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that Class A is not present in Indiana. B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0. C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2. D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6. E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5. F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable. The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35: ""The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios. ""Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data.

Permissive tracts have been defined by the U.S. Geological Survey (Open File Report 95-681, Singer, D.A., 1993, Basic concepts in three-part quantitative assessments of undiscovered mineral resources: Nonrenewable Resources, v. 2, no. 2, p. 69-81) as ""areas where the geology permits the existence of mineral deposits (mineral resource potential) of a specific type... Noting that the possibility of the occurrence of the specified deposit type (mineral resource) outside the permissive tract should be negligible."" This shapefile provides an approximate economic ranking of the sand and gravel resource potential of each mapped surficial unconsolidated deposit. The resource potential of each map unit within the mapped surficial unconsolidated deposits is ranked as a ""potential,"" ""low potential,"" or ""not a potential"" resource.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns.

The average conservation value for riparian buffers of 1-2 ordered streams, 3-5 ordered streams, and 6-12 ordered streams were then calculated for the small watersheds. Each of the above groups were then weighted and added together and quantiled into 10 classes to create an overall Riparian Buffer Quality by small watershed data set. Conservation values were determined by SmartConservation (registerd trademark) methodology. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion in Pennsylvania.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation.

The Land Recycling Program includes four bills. Act 2, Act 3, and Act 4 were signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge on May 19, 1995. Act 6 amended Act 4 and became effective in May 2000. Act 2 of 1995 is the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act. This act is the primary law establishing the Land Recycling Program. It creates a realistic framework for setting cleanup standards, provides special incentives for developing abandoned sites, releases responsible parties from liability when cleanup standards are met, set deadlines for Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) action and provides funding for environmental studies and cleanups. Act 3 of 1995 is the Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act. This act limits the environmental liability of those involved in redeveloping and financing a recycled industrial site. Act 4 of 1995 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act.

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage. This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground. The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most popular example of this configuration. Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS. Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes. While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations. Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is known as the flight deck. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck. The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft. In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle. Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream. The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1. Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure. An aluminum flat plate i used to represent the aft deck. The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck. A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors show that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction. Additional scaling with the nozzle heights are also presented. The numerical simulations were performed using a fully viscous, hybrid RANS/LES model. They were set up to match the nozzle characteristics and run conditions performed in the experiment. A detailed comparison between the unsteady pressures predicted by the computational simulations and that measured by the experiment is presented. Several discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are the result of numerical error caused by the time marching scheme used in the simulations. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is introduced to further analyze the computational simulations and provide a filtering method to obtain more accurate results. For more information, see the doctoral thesis of Michael Lurie on file with the Aerospace Engineering department, titled The Prediction of Unsteady Aerodynamic Loading in High Aspect Ratio Wall Bounded Jets.","The Pennsylvania State University","","intelligenceMilitary","http://www.datacommons.psu.edu/","","","","","","",

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California. Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has been compiled for many streams, and hatchery return data has been compiled for the states mitigation facilities. A draft format has been developed for juvenile abundance and awaits final approval. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG). These features generally represent abundance counts resulting from stream surveys. The linear features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. This would be the reach or length of stream surveyed, or the stream sections for which a given population estimate applies. In some cases the actual stream section surveyed was not specified and linear features represent the entire stream. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same length of stream, and so, linear features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the ""link"" that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.

The study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to connect image analysis of the area to ecological assessment of tree cover change trends over the last 15 years. In addition, AMERICAN FORESTS created a ""green data layer"" -a digital tool that local communities can use to integrate urban forest ecology into their future planning. Frankford Tacony, Mill Creek and Cobbs Creek in Pennsylvania and the Big Timber in New Jersey were selected for analysis and to create a detailed (4-meter resolution) digital landcover.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Natural vegetation cover (Water, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, Woody Wetland, and Emergent Wetland) from the 2005 Land Cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the contiguous natural vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-100 0 100-250 1 250-500 2 500-1000 3 1000-2500 4 2500-5000 5 5000-7500 6 7500-15000 7 15000-25000 8 25000-40000 9 > 40000 10 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion.

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. The road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Using an inside buffer of 300 feet on the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) from the 2005 land cover, the interior forest raster was created. Acreage of the contiguous interior forest was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-20 0 20-100 1 100-250 2 250-500 3 500-1000 4 1000-2500 5 2500-5000 6 5000-10000 7 10000-15000 8 15000-20000 9 >20000 10 No data 0 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input terrestrial resources data.

It was developed for the express purpose of assisting with steelhead recovery planning efforts. The distributions reported in this dataset were derived from a subset of the data contained in the Aquatic Species Observation Database (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species observation data capture application. ASOD is an ongoing project designed to capture as complete a set of statewide inland aquatic vertebrate species observation information as possible. Please note: A separate distribution is available for summer-run steelhead. Contact information is the same as for the above. ASOD Observation data were used to develop a network of stream segments. These lines are developed by ""tracing down"" from each observation to the sea using the flow properties of USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High Resolution hydrography. Lastly these lines, representing stream segments, were assigned a value of either Anad Present (Anadromous present), or Unsp Present (Unspecified O. mykiss present). The end result (i.e., this layer) consists of a set of lines representing the distribution of steelhead based on observations in the Aquatic Species Observation Database. This dataset represents stream reaches that are known or believed to be used by steelhead based on steelhead observations. Thus, it contains only positive steelhead occurrences. The absence of distribution on a stream does not necessarily indicate that steelhead do not utilize that stream. Additionally, steelhead may not be found in all streams or reaches each year. This is due to natural variations in run size, water conditions, and other environmental factors. The information in this data set should be used as an indicator of steelhead presence/suspected presence at the time of the observation as indicated by the 'Late_Yr' (Latest Year) field attribute. The line features in the dataset may not represent the maximum extent of steelhead on a stream; rather it is important to note that this distribution most likely underestimates the actual distribution of steelhead. This distribution is based on observations found in the ASOD database. The individual observations may not have occurred at the upper extent of anadromous occupation. In addition, no attempt was made to capture every observation of O. mykiss and so it should not be assumed that this dataset is complete for each stream. The distribution dataset was built solely from the ASOD observational data. No additional data (habitat mapping, barriers data, gradient modeling, etc.) were utilized to either add to or validate the data. It is very possible that an anadromous observation in this dataset has been recorded above (upstream of) a barrier as identified in the Passage Assessment Database (PAD). In the near future, we hope to perform a comparative analysis between this dataset and the PAD to identify and resolve all such discrepancies. Such an analysis will add rigor to and help validate both datasets. This dataset has recently undergone a review. Data source contributors as well as CDFG fisheries biologists were provided the opportunity to review and suggest edits or additions during the review. Initially data contributors were notified and invited to review and comment on the handling of the information that they provided. The distribution was then posted to an intranet mapping application and CDFG biologists were provided an opportunity to review and comment on the dataset. During this review, biologists were also encouraged to add new observation data. This resulting final distribution contains their suggestions and additions. Please refer to ""Use Constraints"" section below.","California Department of Fish and Game###Connie Shannon PSMFC/ CDFG###Eric Haney, Region 1, Information Services Branch Manager","","Endangered species###Recovery Planning###Steelhead###Distribution###Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus###Threatened Species###Winter-run###Salmonid###Species Recovery###inlandWaters","http://www.calfish.org/FishDataandMaps/DataDownloads/tabid/90/Default.aspx","Southern California Coast###South Central California Coast###California###Central Valley###Central California Coast###Northern California","","","","","",

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

It sets standards, by law for the first time, that are protective of human health and the environment, but which consider future use. It provides potential developers with clear cleanup standards based on risk, not a moving target in a negotiated agreement, and provides an end to liability when that cleanup standard is achieved. The Land Recycling Program includes four bills. Act 2, Act 3, and Act 4 were signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge on May 19, 1995. Act 6 amended Act 4 and became effective in May 2000. Act 2 of 1995 is the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act. This act is the primary law establishing the Land Recycling Program. It creates a realistic framework for setting cleanup standards, provides special incentives for developing abandoned sites, releases responsible parties from liability when cleanup standards are met, set deadlines for Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) action and provides funding for environmental studies and cleanups. Act 3 of 1995 is the Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act. This act limits the environmental liability of those involved in redeveloping and financing a recycled industrial site. Act 4 of 1995 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act. This act provides up to $2 million for environmental assessments in certain communities and for cleanups in certain cities through the Department of Community and Economic Development.

It was beyond the scope of the project to incorporate revisions that had been made to the geologic units since the 1980 map was compiled; however, some updates to formational contacts, faults, and dikes, as well as to geologic nomenclature and ages, were incorporated where the revisions could be easily made. The 1980 Pennsylvania state geologic map (Berg and others, 1980) shows the areal distribution of 194 bedrock geologic units. The units range in geologic age from Quaternary to Precambrian and encompass a wide variety of lithologies. The map was compiled and published in a transverse mercator projection at 1:250,000 scale. The two digital data sets include 195 geologic units, which, for the most part, closely correspond to those shown on the 1980 map. The data sets were prepared using ArcInfo software and are provided in a geographic coordinate system (units in decimal degrees). Although it is possible to portray digital data at any scale, the geologic formational contacts, faults, and dikes represented in these data sets are not intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:250,000. The polygon attributes in the data set for geologic contacts and faults include unit number, map symbol, name, age, and three lithology categories that represent the general lithologic makeup of each geologic unit. Each arc (line) in the data set is attributed as one or more of the three general categories of contact, fault, or border. Contact lines are attributed according to the type of contact shown on the 1980 map (solid, dashed, queried, or arbitrary). Fault lines are similarly attributed (solid, dashed, or queried). Borders are attributed as either state boundaries, quadrangle boundaries, or the shoreline of Lake Erie. The data set for dikes consists of arcs attributed with unit number, map symbol, name, age, lithology, and type of dike (solid or dashed). It is anticipated that the digital data sets will be used for a variety of regional or statewide geographic-information-system applications, including water-resource and environmental studies, conservation and ecosystem management, mineral exploration, and regional land use planning and development.","Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources","Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey","Lithologies###Jurassic###Faults###Triassic###Geologic map###Geologic units###Formations###Silurian###Formational contacts###Permian###Lower Paleozoic###Tertiary###Dikes###Cretaceous###Areal geology###Bedrock geology###geoscientificinformation###Mississippian###Pennsylvanian###Geology###Surface geology###Quaternary###Cambrian###Rock types###Precambrian###Ordovician###Devonian","http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/map1/bedmap.aspx#entirestate","Monticello 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Pennsylvania###Towanda 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Williamsport West 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Ashtabula 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Oil City 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###York 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Harrisburg 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Scranton 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Sunbury 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Williamsport East 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###East Liverpool 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Morgantown 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Johnstown 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Wellsboro 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Erie 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Tyrone 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Wilmington 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Reading 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Indiana 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Bradford 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Hagerstown 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Honesdale 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Allentown 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Carlisle 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Pittsburgh West 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Pittsburgh East 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Moundsville 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Cumberland 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###State College 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Trenton 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Warren 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Clearfield 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Youngstown 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Jamestown 30- by 60-minute quadrangle###Middletown 30- by 60-minute quadrangle","","","","","",

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials.

The distributions reported in this dataset were derived from a subset of the data contained in the Aquatic Species Observation Database (ASOD), a Microsoft Access multi-species observation data capture application. ASOD is an ongoing project designed to capture as complete a set of statewide inland aquatic vertebrate species observation information as possible. Please note: A separate distribution is available for winter-run steelhead. Contact information is the same as for the above. ASOD Observation data were used to develop a network of stream segments. These lines are developed by ""tracing down"" from each observation to the sea using the flow properties of USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) High Resolution hydrography. Lastly these lines, representing stream segments, were assigned a value of either Anad Present (Anadromous present). The end result (i.e., this layer) consists of a set of lines representing the distribution of steelhead based on observations in the Aquatic Species Observation Database. This dataset represents stream reaches that are known or believed to be used by steelhead based on steelhead observations. Thus, it contains only positive steelhead occurrences. The absence of distribution on a stream does not necessarily indicate that steelhead do not utilize that stream. Additionally, steelhead may not be found in all streams or reaches each year. This is due to natural variations in run size, water conditions, and other environmental factors. The information in this data set should be used as an indicator of steelhead presence/suspected presence at the time of the observation as indicated by the 'Late_Yr' (Latest Year) field attribute. The line features in the dataset may not represent the maximum extent of steelhead on a stream; rather it is important to note that this distribution most likely underestimates the actual distribution of steelhead. This distribution is based on observations found in the ASOD database. The individual observations may not have occurred at the upper extent of anadromous occupation. In addition, no attempt was made to capture every observation of O. mykiss and so it should not be assumed that this dataset is complete for each stream. The distribution dataset was built solely from the ASOD observational data. No additional data (habitat mapping, barriers data, gradient modeling, etc.) were utilized to either add to or validate the data. It is very possible that an anadromous observation in this dataset has been recorded above (upstream of) a barrier as identified in the Passage Assessment Database (PAD). In the near future, we hope to perform a comparative analysis between this dataset and the PAD to identify and resolve all such discrepancies. Such an analysis will add rigor to and help validate both datasets. This dataset has recently undergone a review. Data source contributors as well as CDFG fisheries biologists have been provided the opportunity to review and suggest edits or additions during a recent review. Data contributors were notified and invited to review and comment on the handling of the information that they provided. The distribution was then posted to an intranet mapping application and CDFG biologists were provided an opportunity to review and comment on the dataset. During this review, biologists were also encouraged to add new observation data. This resulting final distribution contains their suggestions and additions.

The network of observatories, linked through common instrumentation, data access, and operation, form a ""shared"" facility and as such provide an important means of building science community. Data from the observatories provide the underpinning for much of the science supported by AfricaArray. Some of the observatories are permanent, while others are installed and operated on a temporary basis. The scientific observatories are built around broadband seismic stations for recording earthquakes. The reason for this is because the initial focus of AfricaArray was in geophysics. The goal during the first phase of AfricaArray (2005-2007) was to establish a network of 20 to 30 permanent observatories spanning much of southern and eastern Africa. The placement of permanent observatories in many countries was governed by the location of existing seismic stations. Seismic equipment at many of these stations has been upgraded, the data have been formatted uniformly and archived, and access to the data has been streamlined. During the second phase of AfricaArray (2008-2010), the network of permanent observatories was expanded into other parts of Africa, and starting in August, 2010, many of the observatories are being equipped with GPS receivers and automated weather stations.","The Pennsylvania State University","","weather###geoscientificinformation","http://www.africaarray.psu.edu/stations_data/default.asp","","","","","","",

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Grasslands vegetation cover (Pasture/Grass) from the 2005 land cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of ""0"" to areas in the Grasslands land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the grasslands vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-50 0 50-100 1 100-300 3 300-500 4 500-600 5 600-950 6 >950 7 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input terrestrial resources data.

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California. Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has also been compiled for many streams. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG). These features represent abundance information resulting from counts at weirs, fish ladders, or other point-type monitoring protocols such as beach seining. The point features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same point location, and so, point features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the ""link"" field that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

The sub-facility types related to Captive Hazardous Waste Operations that are included in eMapPA are: Boiler/Industrial Furnace, Disposal Facility, Hazardous Generator, Incinerator, Recycling Facility, Storage Facility, and Treatment Facility._______Captive Hazardous Waste Operation Sub-Facility Types Boiler or Industrial Furnace: Facility permitted by DEP to burn or process hazardous waste generated onsite, to recover thermal energy, or to accomplish recovery of materials in association with a manufacturing process. Disposal Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to dispose of hazardous waste generated onsite by incineration, or by intentionally placing the waste in or on land or water in specially designed and constructed containment units where the waste will remain after closure of the facility. Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated onsite at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Incinerator: Facility permitted by DEP to burn or thermally combust hazardous waste generated onsite in an enclosed device using controlled flame. Devices meeting the criteria for classification as a boiler, industrial furnace, carbon regeneration unit, or sludge dryer are not incinerators. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to treat hazardous waste generated onsite, making it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to hold hazardous waste generated onsite for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated, disposed of, or stored elsewhere. Facilities accumulating hazardous wastes generated onsite in accordance with prescribed generator accumulation standards for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) are NOT storage facilities. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated onsite. The purpose is to neutralize the waste or to render the waste non-hazardous, safer for transport, suitable for recovery, suitable for storage, or reduced in volume.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","efacts, waste, hazardous, Captive Hazardous Waste Operation, CAHWO###environment","http://www.pasda.psu.edu","","","","","","",

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse. Surface Mine Surface mining of coal by removing material which lies above the coal seam.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 54 encompasses whole or portions of several states including the states of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse. Surface Mine Surface mining of coal by removing material which lies above the coal seam.

Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated on-site at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and treat the waste to make it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and hold the waste for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated or disposed of at the same facility, or treated, disposed, or stored elsewhere. Additional permitting is necessary if the waste is treated or disposed at the storage facility itself. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated off-site.

The sub-facility types related to Captive Hazardous Waste Operations that are included in eMapPA are: Boiler/Industrial Furnace, Disposal Facility, Hazardous Generator, Incinerator, Recycling Facility, Storage Facility, and Treatment Facility._______Captive Hazardous Waste Operation Sub-Facility Types Boiler or Industrial Furnace: Facility permitted by DEP to burn or process hazardous waste generated onsite, to recover thermal energy, or to accomplish recovery of materials in association with a manufacturing process. Disposal Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to dispose of hazardous waste generated onsite by incineration, or by intentionally placing the waste in or on land or water in specially designed and constructed containment units where the waste will remain after closure of the facility. Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated onsite at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Incinerator: Facility permitted by DEP to burn or thermally combust hazardous waste generated onsite in an enclosed device using controlled flame. Devices meeting the criteria for classification as a boiler, industrial furnace, carbon regeneration unit, or sludge dryer are not incinerators. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to treat hazardous waste generated onsite, making it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to hold hazardous waste generated onsite for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated, disposed of, or stored elsewhere. Facilities accumulating hazardous wastes generated onsite in accordance with prescribed generator accumulation standards for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) are NOT storage facilities. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated onsite. The purpose is to neutralize the waste or to render the waste non-hazardous, safer for transport, suitable for recovery, suitable for storage, or reduced in volume.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","efacts, waste, hazardous, Captive Hazardous Waste Operation, CAHWO###environment","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/","","","","","","",

Air Emissions Plant is a DEP primary facility type related to the Air Quality Program. The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage. This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground. The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most popular example of this configuration. Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS. Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes. While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations. Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is known as the flight deck. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck. The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft. In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle. Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream. The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1. Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure. An aluminum flat plate i used to represent the aft deck. The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck. A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors show that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction. Additional scaling with the nozzle heights are also presented. The numerical simulations were performed using a fully viscous, hybrid RANS/LES model. They were set up to match the nozzle characteristics and run conditions performed in the experiment. A detailed comparison between the unsteady pressures predicted by the computational simulations and that measured by the experiment is presented. Several discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are the result of numerical error caused by the time marching scheme used in the simulations. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is introduced to further analyze the computational simulations and provide a filtering method to obtain more accurate results.

One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 47 encompasses whole or portions of several states including the states of Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Missouri. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 47 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the National Center, EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.","U.S. Geological Survey","U.S. Geological Survey","tree canopy###GIS###imageryBaseMapsEarthCover###U.S. Geological Survey###digital spatial data###USGS###imagery###Base Maps###Earth Cover","http://www.mrlc.gov","United States###U.S.###US###zone 47###Kentucky###IN###KY###Indiana###OH###MO###Tennessee###Ohio###TN###Missouri","","","","","",

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse. Surface Mine Surface mining of coal by removing material which lies above the coal seam.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

In the first phase, a preliminary surficial deposit map was made using soil mapping (Grubb, 1986), surficial deposit mapping (Denny and Lyford, 1963), bedrock mapping (Sherwood and Platt, 1880; Sevon, 1977), and landform analysis using the 1:24,000-scale topographic map and aerial photographs. In the second phase, the preliminary surficial deposit map was verified and/or corrected during twenty person-days or so of field work. Two undergraduate geologic field assistants, Stephanie Jones and Christopher Guise, were responsible for much of the field mapping. Christopher Guise was responsible for most of southern two-thirds of the map that lies south of Loyalsock Creek, an area largely occupied by State Gamelands. Stephanie Jones was responsible for most of the northern one-third of the map, the area lying north of Loyalsock Creek. Duane Braun, surficial geology mapper, spot checked the work of the field assistants across the entire map and directly mapped the eastern end of the Bernice Coal Basin and the southwestern corner of the map within the Painter Den hunting club lands. In the third phase, the field verified/corrected preliminary surficial geology map was finalized, drafted onto three mylar overlays (contacts, isochores, and labels - rock outcrops), and had a text added by Duane Braun. In the fourth phase, the mylar overlays were scanned, digitized, and produced in Adobe PDF and ArcGIS formats by Pennsylvania Geologic Survey personnel. The distribution and type of units on the preliminary surficial geology map is primarily a combined parent material and topographic position classification of the soil survey map units. The classification of all soil series by surficial deposit map unit is given in Table 1. Many soil series are common to more than one surficial deposit type. The landform of a specific area is used to decide which surficial deposit type the soil series is most likely related to at that site on the preliminary surficial geology map. The soil series boundaries are manually transferred from the 1:20,000-scale soil survey maps to the 1:24,000-scale topographic map. During the field verification and correction phase many contacts are moved to reflect conditions directly observed in the field. Positions of the boundary lines are estimated by eye using natural and human features that are identifiable on both the soil survey aerial photographs and the topographic map. At some sites a GPS unit was used to better local a contact or feature. Expectable line location error is on the order of 50 to 100 feet on the ground where there are distinct features to guide line placement. Where boundaries cross large featureless areas of forest, line placement error is in the range of 100 feet and occasionally as much as 200 feet on the ground.","Dr. Duane D.

Air Emissions Plant is a DEP primary facility type related to the Air Quality Program. The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns. Continuous Emission Monitoring Point: Devices attached to smokestacks that monitor specific pollutants, i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","environment###efacts, AEP, Air Emission Plant, Air","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census. The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs): ""ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPSs ZIP Code delivery areas.  ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another."" For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP: ""The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.

In the first phase, a preliminary surficial deposit map was made using soil mapping (Grubb, 1986), surficial deposit mapping (Denny and Lyford, 1963), bedrock mapping (Sherwood and Platt, 1880; Sevon, 1977), and landform analysis using the 1:24,000-scale topographic map and aerial photographs. In the second phase, the preliminary surficial deposit map was verified and/or corrected during twenty person-days or so of field work. Two undergraduate geologic field assistants, Stephanie Jones and Christopher Guise, were responsible for much of the field mapping. Christopher Guise was responsible for most of southern two-thirds of the map that lies south of Loyalsock Creek, an area largely occupied by State Gamelands. Stephanie Jones was responsible for most of the northern one-third of the map, the area lying north of Loyalsock Creek. Duane Braun, surficial geology mapper, spot checked the work of the field assistants across the entire map and directly mapped the eastern end of the Bernice Coal Basin and the southwestern corner of the map within the Painter Den hunting club lands. In the third phase, the field verified/corrected preliminary surficial geology map was finalized, drafted onto three mylar overlays (contacts, isochores, and labels - rock outcrops), and had a text added by Duane Braun. In the fourth phase, the mylar overlays were scanned, digitized, and produced in Adobe PDF and ArcGIS formats by Pennsylvania Geologic Survey personnel. The distribution and type of units on the preliminary surficial geology map is primarily a combined parent material and topographic position classification of the soil survey map units. The classification of all soil series by surficial deposit map unit is given in Table 1. Many soil series are common to more than one surficial deposit type. The landform of a specific area is used to decide which surficial deposit type the soil series is most likely related to at that site on the preliminary surficial geology map. The soil series boundaries are manually transferred from the 1:20,000-scale soil survey maps to the 1:24,000-scale topographic map. During the field verification and correction phase many contacts are moved to reflect conditions directly observed in the field. Positions of the boundary lines are estimated by eye using natural and human features that are identifiable on both the soil survey aerial photographs and the topographic map. At some sites a GPS unit was used to better local a contact or feature. Expectable line location error is on the order of 50 to 100 feet on the ground where there are distinct features to guide line placement. Where boundaries cross large featureless areas of forest, line placement error is in the range of 100 feet and occasionally as much as 200 feet on the ground.","Dr. Duane D.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

Air Emissions Plant is a DEP primary facility type related to the Air Quality Program. The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns. Continuous Emission Monitoring Point: Devices attached to smokestacks that monitor specific pollutants, i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","environment###efacts, AEP, Air Emission Plant, Air","ftp://www.pasda.psu.edu/pub/pasda/dep","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

The primary digital orthophotoquad (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75-minutes of latitude by 3.75-minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quad plus The overedge ranges a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The standard, archived digital orthophoto is formatted as four ASCII header records, followed by a series of 8-bit binary image data records. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels ranging from 0 to 255. The metadata embedded in the digital orthophoto contain a wide range of descriptive information including format source information, production instrumentation and dates, and data to assist with displaying and georeferencing the image. DOQ images are acquired as a part of the USGS' National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP). Through NAPP imagery for each state is produced on a 7 year cycle.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

Air Emissions Plant is a DEP primary facility type related to the Air Quality Program. The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators.

The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools.

Disposal Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to dispose of hazardous waste generated onsite by incineration, or by intentionally placing the waste in or on land or water in specially designed and constructed containment units where the waste will remain after closure of the facility. Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated onsite at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Incinerator: Facility permitted by DEP to burn or thermally combust hazardous waste generated onsite in an enclosed device using controlled flame. Devices meeting the criteria for classification as a boiler, industrial furnace, carbon regeneration unit, or sludge dryer are not incinerators. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to treat hazardous waste generated onsite, making it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to hold hazardous waste generated onsite for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated, disposed of, or stored elsewhere. Facilities accumulating hazardous wastes generated onsite in accordance with prescribed generator accumulation standards for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) are NOT storage facilities. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated onsite. The purpose is to neutralize the waste or to render the waste non-hazardous, safer for transport, suitable for recovery, suitable for storage, or reduced in volume.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","efacts, waste, hazardous, Captive Hazardous Waste Operation, CAHWO###utilitiesCommunication###environment","http://www.pasda.psu.edu","","","","","","",

General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns. Continuous Emission Monitoring Point: Devices attached to smokestacks that monitor specific pollutants, i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","efacts, AEP, Air Emission Plant, Air###environment","http://www.pasda.psu.edu","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

Street Centerlines are classified as Primary Road, Secondary Road, Unpaved Road, Limited Access Road, Connecting Road, Jeep Trail, Walkway, Stairway, Alleyway and Unknown. A Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction. A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction. An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel. A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway. A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street. A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together. Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown. Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update. Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature. A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together. Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update. An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads. Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways. A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation. A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature. A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed. Centerlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement. One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement. Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present. For roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement. All attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated. For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR. If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004. The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified. The ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps. Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed. In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads. Street Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset. In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area. Street Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area. The Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field. In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset. When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004. All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values. All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used. In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection. Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range. All new Street Centerlines will have zero (0) for ""SystemID"" and ""UserID"".","Allegheny County Division of Computer Services Geographic Information Systems Group","Allegheny County Division of Computer Services Geographic Information Systems Group","transportation","http://www.pasda.psu.edu","PA###Clairton###Duquesne###McKeesport###Pittsburgh","","","","","",

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California. Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has been compiled for many streams, and hatchery return data has been compiled for the states mitigation facilities. A draft format has been developed for juvenile abundance and awaits final approval. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG). These features generally represent abundance counts resulting from stream surveys. The linear features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. This would be the reach or length of stream surveyed, or the stream sections for which a given population estimate applies.

County-wide karst-feature inventories for fourteen counties (Adams, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and York) were originally released as hard-copy open file reports by the agency. The user of this dataset would be well served to consult one of those reports for specifics on how the inventories were conducted. Data are also provided from incidental reports of karst features as well as partial or cursory inventories in eight additional counties (Bedford, Blair, Clinton, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lycoming, and Mifflin). The majority of these features were identified on contact prints of USDA, USGS, and other aerial photography. Photo locations were then transferred to paper copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles where the coordinates for the locations were determined using a constantly evolving array of technologies from mylar overlay grids, through early proprietary mapping software and more recently with GIS and GPS technology. . Some features in urbanized areas were identified via questionaires that were sent to the municipalities in the counties being inventoried. The locations of surface mines and cave entrances were garnered from historical geological publicatons. Locations of historical iron mines and other activities often associated with karst features were garnered from historical geological publications. Field surveys were undertaken to establish protocol for future mapping efforts as well as to verify the field presence of interpreted features. Field verified sites are not identified in the data set. Karst features change considerablely over time. Sinkholes become filled or subsidence is repaired. One of the motivations for the karst inventory program was the rapid development taking place in many of the counties where karst could be a problem. Development obliterates much of the evidence for underlying karst features.","Bureau of Toppographic and Geologic Survey, Department of Conservaton and Natural Resources","","geoscientificinformation###surface depression###karst###carbonate###limestone###sinkhole","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/","Lebanon County###Lehigh County###Cumberland County###Fulton County###Blair County###Lycoming County###Pennsylvania###Chester County###York County###Lancaster County###Northampton County###Bucks County###Berks County###Bedford County###Dauphin County###Huntingdon County###Centre County###Montgomery County###Juniata County###Adams County###Clinton County###Franklin County###Mifflin County","","","","","",

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials.

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage. This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground. The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most popular example of this configuration. Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS. Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes. While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations. Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is known as the flight deck. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck. The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft. In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle. Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream. The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1. Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure. An aluminum flat plate i used to represent the aft deck. The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck. A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors show that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction. Additional scaling with the nozzle heights are also presented. The numerical simulations were performed using a fully viscous, hybrid RANS/LES model. They were set up to match the nozzle characteristics and run conditions performed in the experiment. A detailed comparison between the unsteady pressures predicted by the computational simulations and that measured by the experiment is presented. Several discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are the result of numerical error caused by the time marching scheme used in the simulations. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is introduced to further analyze the computational simulations and provide a filtering method to obtain more accurate results. For more information, see the doctoral thesis of Michael Lurie on file with the Aerospace Engineering department, titled The Prediction of Unsteady Aerodynamic Loading in High Aspect Ratio Wall Bounded Jets.","The Pennsylvania State University","","intelligenceMilitary","http://www.datacommons.psu.edu/","","","","","","",

Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Delaware This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage. This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground. The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most popular example of this configuration. Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS. Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes. While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations. Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is known as the flight deck. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck. The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft. In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle. Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream. The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1. Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure. An aluminum flat plate i used to represent the aft deck. The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck. A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors show that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction. Additional scaling with the nozzle heights are also presented. The numerical simulations were performed using a fully viscous, hybrid RANS/LES model. They were set up to match the nozzle characteristics and run conditions performed in the experiment. A detailed comparison between the unsteady pressures predicted by the computational simulations and that measured by the experiment is presented. Several discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are the result of numerical error caused by the time marching scheme used in the simulations. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is introduced to further analyze the computational simulations and provide a filtering method to obtain more accurate results.

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.","U.S. Geological Survey","","Land Use/Land Cover###ImageryBaseMapsEarthCover###Land Resources###Remote Sensing###Land Management","ftp://ftp.chesapeakebay.net/Gis/CBLCD_Series/","","","","","","",

The CHRPD was created in 1999 to capture and maintain data about habitat restoration projects in California benefiting anadromous fish. The CHRPD is managed and supported by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), and funded by NOAA Fisheries and CDFG. Project locations are georeferenced by heads-up digitizing using two different methods. In-stream points and lines are tied directly to California hydrography using a customized ArcView extension, and all polygons and non-stream points and lines are digitized and maintained as shapefiles. Project locations are digitized in as much detail as possible based on the contractors' maps. A background layer of 1:24,000 DRG Quads was used to locate the projects precisely. All points and lines have been buffered to at least 25 meters and merged with the polygon shapefile to create a single shapefile with all project locations. The shapefile was generalized to reduce the file size, at a tolerance of 10 meters. WHAT EACH RECORD REPRESENTS: The CHRPD_070518_all.shp shapefile represents individual project sites of a completed or ongoing restoration project in the California Habitat Restoration Project Database as of May 2007.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

The vegetation map shows the locations of National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) plant communities (associations) at EFMO and immediate surroundings. Thematic accuracy requirements by the VMP specify 80% accuracy for map classes (themes) representing plant communities. During 2002, field classification data from 369 locations were collected at EFMO and nearby public lands for a thematic accuracy assessment (AA) to the vegetation map. The sites were randomly generated, stratified to map class themes representing National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) natural/semi-natural plant communities using VMP standards. Of the 369 accuracy assessment sites collected, 34 sites representing NVCS Formation level types or open water were dropped to evaluate exclusively those map classes representing NVCS plant communities. Data from 335 sites were used in the final analysis. Regardless of their use in the analysis, all 369 AA sites are represented in the accuracy assessment site spatial database.

Air Emissions Plant is a DEP primary facility type related to the Air Quality Program. The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns.

Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

One aspect of the water-quality restoration is the refinement of strategies designed to implement nutrient-reduction practices within the Bay watershed. These strategies are being refined and implemented by resource managers of the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP), a partnership comprised of various Federal, State, and local agencies that includes jurisdictions within Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an active member of the CBP, provides necessary water-quality information for these Chesapeake Bay nutrient-reduction strategy revisions and evaluations. The formulation and revision of effective nutrient-reduction strategies requires detailed scientific information and an analytical understanding of the sources, transport, and delivery of nutrients to the Chesapeake Bay. The USGS is supporting these strategies by providing scientific information to resource managers that can help them evaluate and understand these processes. One statistical model available to resource managers is a collection of SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed (SPARROW) attributes, which uses a nonlinear regression approach to spatially relate nutrient sources and watershed characteristics to nutrient loads of streams throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Developed by the USGS, information generated by SPARROW can help resource managers determine the geographical distribution and relative contribution of nutrient sources and the factors that affect their transport to the Bay. Nutrient source information representing the late 1990s time period was obtained from several agencies and used to create and compile digital spatial datasets of total nitrogen and total phosphorus contributions that served as input sources to the SPARROW models. These data represent atmospheric deposition, point-source locations, land-use, land-cover, and agricultural sources such as commercial fertilizer and manure applications. Watershed-characteristics datasets representing factors that affect the transport of nutrients also were compiled from previous applications of the SPARROW models in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Datasets include average-annual precipitation and temperature, slope, soil permeability, and hydrogeomorphic regions. Nutrient-input and watershed-characteristics datasets representing conditions during the late 1990s were merged with a connected network of stream reaches and watersheds to provide the spatial detail required by SPARROW. Stream-nutrient load estimates for 125 sampling sites (87 for total nitrogen and 103 for total phosphorus) served as the dependent variables for the regressions, and were used to calibrate models of total nitrogen and total phosphorus depicting late 1990s conditions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Spatial data generated for the models can be used to identify the location of nutrient sources, while the models' nutrient estimates can be used to evaluate stream-nutrient load contributed locally by each source evaluated, the amount of local load generated that is transported to the Bay, and the factors that affect the nutrient transport. Applying the SPARROW methodology to late 1990s information completes three time periods (late 1980s, early 1990s, and late 1990s) of viable data that resource managers can use to evaluate the water-quality conditions within the Bay watershed in order to refine restoration goals and nutrient-reduction strategies.","U.S. Geological Survey","Virginia","environment###water data###inlandWaters","http://chesapeake.usgs.gov","Weat Virginia###Pennsylvania###Virginia###Maryland###Delaware###New York###Chesapeke Bay","","","","","",

The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

Over the long term, the rates of weathering and erosion combine to control the evolution of landscapes and help to define the access, rates of motion, and time scales of water and energy within the Critical Zone (CZ).Despite the importance of these processes, we are generally unable to quantitatively predict the rates or mechanisms by which regolith forms or how it controls water flow. Understanding these rates is of particular importance due to the rapid rates of change of the CZ in response to anthropogenic and climate perturbation. Here we propose a Critical Zone Observatory dedicated to developing this understanding for one of the most common lithologies on earth. Our Critical Zone Observatory site, the focus of National Science Foundation-supported research since the 1970s, provides long term datasets for hydrological response that will be augmented here by new geochemical, geomorphological, ecological, and soils datasets. The observatory is a small catchment in central Pennsylvania (hereafter termed the Susquehanna/Shale Hills Observatory or SSHO) on Rose Hill Shale. As a tectonically quiescent and relatively pristine watershed, Shale Hills presents the opportunity to investigate the rates and mechanisms of regolith formation on a simple but ubiquitous bedrock lithology. The regolith at the SSHO has experienced at least two potentially significant perturbations in the geologically recent past: a climatic perturbation from peri-glacial to modern conditions and a biologic perturbation from anthropogenic clearing of forests during colonial occupation.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials.

It sets standards, by law for the first time, that are protective of human health and the environment, but which consider future use. It provides potential developers with clear cleanup standards based on risk, not a moving target in a negotiated agreement, and provides an end to liability when that cleanup standard is achieved. The Land Recycling Program includes four bills. Act 2, Act 3, and Act 4 were signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge on May 19, 1995. Act 6 amended Act 4 and became effective in May 2000. Act 2 of 1995 is the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act. This act is the primary law establishing the Land Recycling Program. It creates a realistic framework for setting cleanup standards, provides special incentives for developing abandoned sites, releases responsible parties from liability when cleanup standards are met, set deadlines for Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) action and provides funding for environmental studies and cleanups. Act 3 of 1995 is the Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act. This act limits the environmental liability of those involved in redeveloping and financing a recycled industrial site. Act 4 of 1995 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act. This act provides up to $2 million for environmental assessments in certain communities and for cleanups in certain cities through the Department of Community and Economic Development. Act 6 of 2000 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act.

Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated on-site at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and treat the waste to make it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and hold the waste for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated or disposed of at the same facility, or treated, disposed, or stored elsewhere. Additional permitting is necessary if the waste is treated or disposed at the storage facility itself. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated off-site.

This site can be used to help you find the particular 2nd PBBA block where you live or where you make any of your breeding bird observations. You can zoom directly to a point by entering a latitude and longitude. Be sure to use decimal degree format and always include a minus (-) sign before the longitude.

Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

It sets standards, by law for the first time, that are protective of human health and the environment, but which consider future use. It provides potential developers with clear cleanup standards based on risk, not a moving target in a negotiated agreement, and provides an end to liability when that cleanup standard is achieved. The Land Recycling Program includes four bills. Act 2, Act 3, and Act 4 were signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge on May 19, 1995. Act 6 amended Act 4 and became effective in May 2000. Act 2 of 1995 is the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act. This act is the primary law establishing the Land Recycling Program. It creates a realistic framework for setting cleanup standards, provides special incentives for developing abandoned sites, releases responsible parties from liability when cleanup standards are met, set deadlines for Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) action and provides funding for environmental studies and cleanups. Act 3 of 1995 is the Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act. This act limits the environmental liability of those involved in redeveloping and financing a recycled industrial site. Act 4 of 1995 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act. This act provides up to $2 million for environmental assessments in certain communities and for cleanups in certain cities through the Department of Community and Economic Development. Act 6 of 2000 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act.

While the need for good geospatial data forms the foundation of the Digital Coast, the basic premise of the siteis the understanding that data alone are not enough. People need the associated tools, training, and information that turn data into information capable of making a difference. And people want this information in one connected package that is easy to use. Digital Coast does just that. The NOAA Coastal Services Center built the prototype in 2008 and then reached out to potential users to provide feedback and guide the development of the site. These project partners, whose organizations eventually formed the Digital Coast Partnership, let the Center know what issues were most important, what type of content they would find most helpful, and the primary barriers they needed addressed. This constituent feedback created a powerhouse website, but then it evolved into much more. The organizations, which formerly lacked a means to interact, found that they had a lot in common. They were able to work together on initiatives that not only benefited their organizations, but also had a big impact on efforts to protect coastal resources and communities. The different perspectives and the creation of new partnerships represented one of those rare all-around wins that organizations dream about.","NOAA Coastal Services Center","","society","http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/index.html","","","","","","",

The vegetation map is of Acadia National Park (NP) and extended environs, providing 99,693 hectares (246,347 acres) of map data. Of this coverage, 52,872 hectares (130,650 acres) is non-vegetated ocean, bay, and estuary (53% of coverage). Acadia NP comprises 19,276 hectares (47,633 acres) of the total data coverage area (19%, 40% not counting ocean and estuary data). Over 7,120 polygons make up the coverage, each with map class description and, for vegetation classes, physiognomic feature information. The spatial database provides crosswalk information to all National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) floristic and physiognomic levels, and to other established classification systems (NatureServe&#146;s U.S. Terrestrial Ecological System Classification, Maine Natural Community Classification, and the USGS Land Use and Land Cover Classification). This mapping project has identified 53 NVCS associations (vegetation communities) at Acadia National Park through analyses of vegetation sample data. These associations are represented in the map coverage with 33 map classes. With all vegetation types, land use classes, and park specific categories combined, 57 map classes define the ground features within the project area (58 classes including the class for no map data). Each polygon within the spatial database map is identified with one of these map classes. In addition, physiognomic modifiers are added to map classes representing vegetation to describe the vegetation structure within a polygon (density, pattern, and height). The spatial database was produced from the interpretation of spring 1997 1:15,840-scale color infrared aerial photographs. The standard minimum mapping unit (MMU) applied is 0.5 hectares (1.25 acres). The interpreted data were transferred and automated using base maps produced from USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles. The finished spatial database is a single seamless coverage, projected in Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 19, with datum in North American Datum of 1983. The estimated overall thematic accuracy for vegetation map classes is 80%.","U.S. Geological Survey, Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, 2630 Fanta Reed Road, La Crosse, Wisconsin 54603","U.S. Geological Survey, Center for Biological Informatics","USNVC###Acadia National Park Vegetation Mapping Project###Vegetation Map###NVCS###USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program###National Park###Vegetation Mapping###National Vegetation Classification Standard###International Vegetation Classification###Land Cover###U.S. National Vegetation Classification###Photo Interpretation###Digital Spatial Database###National Vegetation Classification System###Land Use###Vegetation","","Maine###Schoodic Peninsula###Mount Desert Island###Isle au Haut###Acadia National Park###Bar Harbor###USA###Hancock County","","","","","",

This study also formalized different trend tests and methodologies used in assessing the effectiveness of management actions in reducing nutrients and sediments to the Chesapeake Bay. Trends in streamflow were tested at multiple time scales (daily, seasonal, and annual), resulting in only one significant trend (annual-mean streamflow for the Choptank River near Greensboro, Md.). Total freshwater flow entering the bay for the July-August-September summer season 2004 was the highest ever estimated for that 3-month period (1937-2004). Observed (unbiased) concentration summaries indicate higher ranges in total-nitrogen concentrations in the northern major river basins, those in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and northern Virginia, compared to the more southern basins in Virginia. Almost half of the monitoring sites in the northern basins exhibited significant downward trends in total nitrogen with time. Comparisons with total phosphorus and sediment showed similar results to total nitrogen. Monthly and annual loads were available for the River Input Monitoring Program sites from the U.S. Geological Survey. Although loads were significantly reduced from 2003, in 2004, the combined estimated total nitrogen loads were the third highest since 1990, whereas total phosphorus and sediment loads were the fifth highest. A flow-weighted concentration (FWC) is useful in evaluating changes through time. Combined annual mean total nitrogen FWC from the 9 River Input Monitoring Program sites indicated a downward tendency from 1985 through 1998 and an upward tendency since 2001. From 1990 to 2004, the mean concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and sediment were 1.58, 0.085, and 51 milligrams per liter, respectively. Flow-weighted concentrations for phosphorus and sediment were lower in the Susquehanna River at Conowingo, Md., most likely due to the trapping efficiency of three large reservoirs upstream from the sampling point. Trends in concentrations, not adjusted for flow, identified 10 statistically significant upward trends, and 50 statistically significant downward trends in concentration for the period 1985 through 2004. Trends in concentrations, when adjusted for flow, can be used as an indicator of human activity and management actions. The flow-adjusted trends indicated significant downward trends at approximately 72, 81, and 43 percent of the sites for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and sediment, respectively. This indicates that management actions are having some effect in reducing nutrients and sediments.","U.S. Geological Survey","Virginia","environment###water data###inlandWaters","http://chesapeake.usgs.gov/","Weat Virginia###Pennsylvania###Virginia###Maryland###Delaware###New York###Chesapeke Bay","","","","","",

In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

These output tools are designed to give you access to the data collected by the tens of thousands of CBC volunteers. A lot has happened to early winter bird populations and distributions in the last 100 plus years, and the Christmas Bird Count is an invaluable resource to discover those changes. These tools allow you to ask just about any question you want of the entire CBC database. Take a look! You can make maps of bird distribution, construct graphs of species trends over time, or see the raw count data. See what's happened on your count over time; look up your favorite species; many more discoveries await! Please be aware that the common names of many bird species have changed over time. In order to view all of the data for certain species, you will need to query for each ""historical"" name individually. Currently our CBC historical database is undergoing another round of proofing of the data. A large dataset such as this requires continual proofing, and we welcome any reports of apparent irregularities. To learn the proper citation format for data viewed through the CBC database and a list of scientific articles based on CBC data, see the CBC bibliography page. Thank you for your participation. Please note: To use these CBC tools you will need Netscape/Internet Explorer Version 4.0 or higher.

The 303d data was assigned value based on the attainment of the stream. Attaining streams received a value of 8, unattaining streams received a value of 0, and unassessed streams received a value of 3. The average value for each small watershed was calculated by multiplying each stream segment's length by its assigned value and dividing by the total length of the streams within the watershed. The data was converted to raster and reclassified into 10 quantiles. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest Ecoregion. Therefore, the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data.

The objective of the cultural assessment is to identify lands that provide cultural assets and further inform preservation efforts with spatial information about cultural lands. This spatial information about cultural resources can provide an added value to land preservation because cultural lands provide a historic perspective for interpreting land and people's relationship with it.

This project consists of the creation of 3-band, 24 bit color digital orthophoto tiles for the 5-county, Pennsylvania portion DVRPC's region utilizing a Leica ADS40 digital imaging system. The tiles were delivered in both GeoTIFF and MrSID MG3 formats. A GeoTIFF is a TIFF file which has geographic (or cartographic) data embedded as tags within the TIFF file. The geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and geometry within a geographic information system (GIS) display. MrSID (Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database) is a proprietary, wavelet-based, image compression file format (*.sid) developed and patented by LizardTech, Inc. A 20:1 compresssion ratio was used for the MrSIDs. The complete data set contains 1,540 full ortho tiles in Pennsylvania State Plane South coordinate system, NAD83.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated on-site at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and treat the waste to make it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and hold the waste for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated or disposed of at the same facility, or treated, disposed, or stored elsewhere. Additional permitting is necessary if the waste is treated or disposed at the storage facility itself. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated off-site.

The normal orientation of data is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A-record), followed by a series of profile records (B-records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-meter data spacing, cast on Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection).

The sub-facility types related to Captive Hazardous Waste Operations that are included in eMapPA are: Boiler/Industrial Furnace, Disposal Facility, Hazardous Generator, Incinerator, Recycling Facility, Storage Facility, and Treatment Facility._______Captive Hazardous Waste Operation Sub-Facility Types Boiler or Industrial Furnace: Facility permitted by DEP to burn or process hazardous waste generated onsite, to recover thermal energy, or to accomplish recovery of materials in association with a manufacturing process. Disposal Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to dispose of hazardous waste generated onsite by incineration, or by intentionally placing the waste in or on land or water in specially designed and constructed containment units where the waste will remain after closure of the facility. Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated onsite at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Incinerator: Facility permitted by DEP to burn or thermally combust hazardous waste generated onsite in an enclosed device using controlled flame. Devices meeting the criteria for classification as a boiler, industrial furnace, carbon regeneration unit, or sludge dryer are not incinerators. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to treat hazardous waste generated onsite, making it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to hold hazardous waste generated onsite for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated, disposed of, or stored elsewhere. Facilities accumulating hazardous wastes generated onsite in accordance with prescribed generator accumulation standards for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) are NOT storage facilities. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated onsite. The purpose is to neutralize the waste or to render the waste non-hazardous, safer for transport, suitable for recovery, suitable for storage, or reduced in volume.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","efacts, waste, hazardous, Captive Hazardous Waste Operation, CAHWO###environment","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/","","","","","","",

Chl-a is a photosynthetic pigment common to all microscopic algae - phytoplankton - the main primary producers that comprise the base of the food web in the Bay. This important pigment imparts color to the water that can be detected using advanced radiometers. Clear blue water has low chl-a and strongly reflects light at wavelengths at the low end of the visible spectrum, whereas green water has higher chl-a and absorbs strongly in the blue, reflecting light at longer wavelengths. We collect data using airborne radiometric instruments that allow us to measure the reflected light and ascertain concentrations of chl-a.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and the Minneapolis Office of NatureServe in Minneapolis, Minnesota, have completed mapping and classification of existing plant communities of Effigy Mounds National Monument (EFMO) and extended surroundings. Photointerpreters, ecologists, and botanists collaborated to describe National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) plant communities (associations) and determine how best to map them using aerial photographs. --- Two vegetation map coverages were produced, the Yellow River and Sny Magill Units and their respective environs. Vegetation and land use were interpreted using high-quality mirror stereoscopes and 1:8,000-scale color infrared aerial photographs dated October 9, 2000. Polygons were mapped to 0.25 ha (0.62 acres) and, for specific classes, to 0.1 ha (0.25 acres). The interpreted data were digitally and spatially referenced using state-of-the-art mapping software, making the map data usable in geographic information systems (GIS). --- Covering 4,972 ha (12,286 acres), 2,844 polygons make up the 2 geospatial map coverages with an average polygon size of 1.7 ha (4.3 acres). Of the area mapped, 2,179 polygons (76.6%) represent NVCS plant communities as defined by NatureServe. Those polygons cover 3,167 ha (7,825 acres; 63.7%) of the total map area. Another 529 polygons (18.6%) represent NVCS Formation level types covering 1,316 ha (3,251 acres; 26.5%) of the total map area. The remaining 136 polygons (4.8%) represent land use features covering 489 ha (1,208 acres; 9.8%). EFMO lands comprise 1,022 ha (2,526 acres; 20.6%) of the map coverage area. About 563 ha (1,390 acres; 11.3%) of the map coverage area is of Iowa's Yellow River State Forest. --- Results from a thematic accuracy assessment of map classes representing NVCS plant communities provide an overall accuracy of 92% (Kappa index of 90%). Most individual map class themes exceed the VMP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. --- The vegetation spatial database coverages are projected in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Zone 15, using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).","U.S. Geological Survey, Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, 2630 Fanta Reed Road, La Crosse, Wisconsin 54603","U.S. Geological Survey, Center for Biological Informatics","Vegetation Map###U.S. National Vegetation Classification###National Park###Photo Interpretation###National Vegetation Classification Standard###Vegetation###USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program###Digital Spatial Database###Effigy Mounds National Monument Vegetation Mapping Project###USNVC###Land Use###Land Cover###Vegetation Mapping###National Vegetation Classification System###International Vegetation Classification###Photointerpretation###NVCS","http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/ftp/pub/vegmapping/efmo/efmobdy.exe###http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/ftp/vegmapping/efmo/efmo.exe###http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/ftp/vegmapping/efmo/efmosdts.exe###http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/efmo/images/vegmap_large.jpg###http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/efmo/images/efmoveg.jpg###http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/ftp/vegmapping/efmo/efmobdysdts.exe","Marquette###USA###Iowa###Sny Magill###EFMO###Clayton County###Effigy Mounds National Monument###Yellow River###Allamakee County###Harpers Ferry","","","","","",

Hazardous Generator: A site where hazardous waste is first produced. The hazardous waste may be accumulated on-site at this facility for a prescribed limited amount of time (usually between 90 and 270 days) without first obtaining a storage permit from the Department, as long as it is done in accordance with prescribed standards. Recycling Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and treat the waste to make it suitable for upcoming recovery of a usable product or material. Storage Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to accept hazardous waste generated off-site, and hold the waste for a temporary period (not to exceed one year). At the end of that period the hazardous waste is treated or disposed of at the same facility, or treated, disposed, or stored elsewhere. Additional permitting is necessary if the waste is treated or disposed at the storage facility itself. Treatment Facility: Facility permitted by DEP to change the physical, chemical or biological character or composition of hazardous waste that is generated off-site.

The Land Recycling Program includes four bills. Act 2, Act 3, and Act 4 were signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge on May 19, 1995. Act 6 amended Act 4 and became effective in May 2000. Act 2 of 1995 is the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act. This act is the primary law establishing the Land Recycling Program. It creates a realistic framework for setting cleanup standards, provides special incentives for developing abandoned sites, releases responsible parties from liability when cleanup standards are met, set deadlines for Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) action and provides funding for environmental studies and cleanups. Act 3 of 1995 is the Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act. This act limits the environmental liability of those involved in redeveloping and financing a recycled industrial site. Act 4 of 1995 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act. This act provides up to $2 million for environmental assessments in certain communities and for cleanups in certain cities through the Department of Community and Economic Development. Act 6 of 2000 is the Industrial Sites Environmental Assessment Act. This act expands the grant program under Act 4 of 1995 and provides for performance-based loans.","PA Dept of Environmental Protection, Geospatial Data Center","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","PASITEFINDER, brownfields, brownfield, industrial site, industrial park, real estate, land recycling, Act 2, Act 3, Act 4, Act 6, environmental remediation standards, redevelopment, grayfield, grayfields###environment","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/###http://www.depweb.state.pa.us/dep/site/default.asp","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.","U.S. Geological Survey","","Land Use/Land Cover###ImageryBaseMapsEarthCover###Land Resources###Remote Sensing###Land Management","ftp://ftp.chesapeakebay.net/Gis/CBLCD_Series/","","","","","","",

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades.

Fire years and approximate seasons of burning were determined by dendrochronologically dating the tree rings, and by studying the relative position of fire scars within the annual rings. Before the experimental burn of 1993 at least six fires burned portions of the island during the past six centuries (AD 1481, 1638, 1753, 1796, 1867, and 1956). Intervals between these fires ranged from 43 to 157 years, with a mean fire interval (MFI) of 95 years. Fire-scarred samples in pine forests adjacent to the island, but separated by wet bog, recorded nearly three times more fire dates during the same time period. Only two of the six fire dates on the island coincided with fire dates on the mainland (1753 and 1796). MFI in the mainland forest, and in two other pine forest sites on the Dubches Plain, ranged from about 25 to 40 years. Preliminary stand age structure estimates on Bor Forest Island, derived from increment cores taken from mature trees, suggests that the overstory is composed of at least two major cohorts establishing approximately 180, and 130 years ago. We speculate that these cohorts established following the fires of 1796 and 1867, respectively. Approximately 50 percent of the fire scars occurred within the earlywood portion of the tree rings, while the remainder occurred within the latewood, or on the boundary between two rings. This indicates that at least half of all past fires occurred during the cambial growing season, which probably extends from about June to July or August in this region. Our findings suggest that relatively small stands of pine forest surrounded by bogs, such as Bor Forest Island, sustain lower fire frequencies because of they are isolated from fires spreading across the larger, more continuous fuels of surrounding forests. Differences in fire sources and frequency suggest that significant differences in forest age structure and species composition might also be expected in landscape patches of different sizes and isolation within the matrix of bogs and river drainages on the Dubches Plain.","Swetnam, Thomas W., Baisan, Christopher H., Ivanova, Gallina A.","","fire history###dendrochronology###tree rings","","Central Siberia###Dubches Plain, Siberia###Bor Forest Island","","","","","",

CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding Evaluate damages to natural resources HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act [This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners. Other The Other primary facility kind includes a mixture of various different cleanup sites, no further action sites, and potential sites. This is optional data that the regional offices are not required to maintain. STSP Storage Tank Spill and Prevention Act Releases and/or ruptures from improperly installed or faulty storage tanks contaminate the Commonwealth's land and water resources. This act was passed to prevent such contamination through ""improved safeguards on the installation and construction of storage tanks.""","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","environment###efacts, Land Recycling Cleanup Location, recycling, land recycling","http://www.pasda.psu.edu","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states including New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.","U.S. Geological Survey","U.S. Geological Survey","GIS###Imperviousness###U.S. Geological Survey###digital spatial data###USGS###imagery###Base Maps###Earth Cover","http://www.mrlc.gov","United States###U.S.###US###zone 60###PA###MD###NJ###VA###DE###District of Columbia###New Jersey###Pennsylvania###Virginia###Maryland###Delaware","","","","","",

The study identified the upstream reach of Foote Brook as actively degrading, entrenched, with over-steepened streambanks. In 2001, a natural channel restoration project took place on Foote Brook in Johnson, Vermont, in order to protect the Route 15 road embankment and bridge abutment, stabilize eroding streambanks, enhance fisheries and wildlife habitat, and increase woody riparian buffers. Prior to the implementation of this project, funding was secured to conduct aquatic insect biomonitoring in order to get pre-restoration data. These results are documented in Phase I of the Foote Brook Macroinvertebrate Biomonitoring project (see Cross Reference for the metadata documenting Phase 1). This report represents Phase II or the post-restoration monitoring phase. Sites along Foote Brook were identified in order to document the condition of the benthic macroinvertebrate community above, at, and below the restoration site. Although these data will not be relied upon to determine impairment, or for enforcement actions, results will assess the impact of the physical channel restoration on the biological integrity of the stream. This assessment is designed as a simple screening level assessment that will be able to detect gross changes in the community over time. The project&#146;s goal is to produce data that can be used to supplement more rigorous assessment carried out periodically by the VT DEC. Other important goals of the project were to involve the local community and school groups through education and outreach. By reaching out to the community in this biomonitoring effort, local residents can undertake stewardship efforts to assess, conserve and improve aquatic resources in Lamoille County. Foote Brook drains 8.49 square miles in the towns of Johnson and Belvidere, Vermont. The waterway rises at an elevation of 2650 feet above sea level and drops 485 feet to its confluence with the Lamoille River. Foote Brook has the highest population of trout for streams in Lamoille County. The channel is primarily a step-pool and plane-bed type system. Nearly the entire watershed is forested above the Route 15 crossing. Insects are common inhabitants of the stream bottom environment and commonly include mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and true flies. Aquatic macroinvertebrates serve as excellent indicators of water quality. Each insect has varying ability to withstand environmental impacts and therefore, any stressor (physical, biological or chemical) imposed on an ecosystem will reveal themselves in the composition of the biological organisms inhabiting that community. For example, sediments from erosion may decrease the variety of insects and other macroinvertebrates that are able to survive and so indicate a loss of biological health Metrics measured in this study include pollution tolerance, sample density, family richness, % contribution of dominant family, and other criteria. The findings from the individual sites were compared with the control (reference) site, which is used as a benchmark for comparison. It was determined that the control site and restoration site rated similarly in their results. In the summary of similarity, if a stream is found to be >79% similar to the reference stream, then it is in a non-impaired state, reflecting a good population of pollution intolerant organisms and good habitat structure. Site 2 (0.50) rated 100% similarity to the reference site, indicating a relatively healthy stream. Site 3 (0.25) rated 76%, falling into the moderately impaired category (29-79%), indicating a decrease of richness and pollution tolerant organisms. NOTE that this metadata was generated using the NBII Biological Profile, and includes information about lineage, methods, and taxonomy that will be lost if imported into a metadata software that doesn't recognize the biological fields (i.e. ArcCatalog).

This land cover dataset is considered current as of summer 2009. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.

Paved Roads are roads that are surfaced with concrete or asphalt. Roads that have been tarred and chipped are also considered paved. Roads surfaced with gravel or packed dirt are considered Unpaved. An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than surrounding roads that runs between, but parallel to, two paved roads. An Alley can be either paved or unpaved. Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways. Road pavement edges that are underneath bridges or overpasses are coded as Hidden. Bridges and Overpasses are delineated along the outside edge of the structure. Portions of bridges that are under other bridges or other objects are coded as Hidden Bridge. Tunnels are shown as lines connecting the apparent width of the tunnel through the earth. Stairways are major pedestrian thoroughfares, either paved or wooden, connecting two (2) roads and typically found on steep hills. Airfield Runways are the edges of Runways, Taxiways and other airfield pavement areas. Driveways that are greater than 300' in length will be digitized and coded as either Paved Road or Unpaved Road. Paved Road edges show the width of the paved area. If the paved road has a paved shoulder, the paved shoulder is shown as part of the paved road. The placement of an unpaved road is subject to interpretation by the photogrammetrist since the road edge may be indefinite due to the imprecise nature of an unpaved surface. Driveways that are over 300' in length are digitized. For a driveway that terminates at a building, it shall be drawn to the building. Driveways will also have a centerline for its entire length.

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation.

Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials.

These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.","U.S. Geological Survey","","Land Use/Land Cover###ImageryBaseMapsEarthCover###Land Resources###Remote Sensing###Land Management","ftp://ftp.chesapeakebay.net/Gis/CBLCD_Series/","","","","","","",

The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape. I found that much of the watershed was still fairly intact, although this varied dramatically by ecoregion. Current protection also varied, and an assessment of vulnerability will help focus protection efforts among the most valuable hubs and corridors.

The MZD collects information on land use, housing and environmental regulations contained in municipal zoning ordinances. The MZD contains 2 databases: the Land Use Database and the Environmental Database. The Land Use Database contains information on land use, housing type and density, and special housing provisions. For each municipality with an adopted zoning ordinance, the database lists the individual zoning districts established by that ordinance (as of November, 1994). Then by district, the database records: a) the types of housing authorized in residential and mixed use districts: b) maximum allowable housing density, if applicable: c) a classification for the non-residential districts: d) the status (whether allowed or not) of three special housing types--group, personal care and nursing homes.

A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse. Surface Mine Surface mining of coal by removing material which lies above the coal seam. Includes, but is not limited to, strip, auger, quarry, dredging, and leaching mines.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection","mine, mining, mines, Coal Mining Operation, coal, CMO###NPDES Discharge Point, NPDES, Discharge, Point, Discharge Point, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, Pollutant, Elimination System###environment","http://www.pasda.psu.edu","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

This information has been used to steer the program's implementation, hence increasing the probability that the program will be successful and sustainable. The protocol and research questions for the Classrooms for the Future/21st Century Teaching and Learning with Technology (CFF) evaluation were developed in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) prior to the implementation of the program in the 2006-2007 academic year. The CFF/EETT Evaluation Project's scope has included the monitoring of the changes taking place in the 453 participating school districts in the CFF program among 9996 participating teaching in 2011. The CFF program has achieved success on the measures that were established to evaluate its implementation and impact. Despite numerous challenges and setbacks (including funding cuts), this reform agenda has continued through professional development activities in the districts (2007 - 2011). Understanding the adoption, diffusion of the reform's message, related implementation practices, and results of the CFF program will help Penn State, PDE, and key stakeholders to interpret the trends that have occurred after implementing the reform initiative. With minor revisions, this CFF evaluation has been adapted to changing contexts and new populations of participating schools. In many respects a continuation of the CFF model, the 2009 - 2010 Pennsylvania Title IID program (EETT) implements the same model of school reform based on changes in teaching practices in technology intensive classrooms. This program encompasses grades 5-12 in a variety of subject areas in low income and low achieving school districts throughout the state and was frequently used by CFF districts to expand this high school reform model into the middle and elementary grades. For more information on the EETT component of the evaluation please click here for a press release about the EETT Evaluation. If you are a researcher or education professional and have questions about the data, our evaluation efforts with the 2010-2011 EETT initiative, or the CFF/EETT Evaluation Projects conclusions about the CFF and EETT programs please contact Robin Clausen at rlc237@psu.edu or 814-574-7722.

Conservationists are in a race against time to protect remaining habitat to stem the loss of biodiversity. Critical to these conservation efforts is focusing on-the-ground actions on the places where threatened species are found. To aid conservationists in determining where these species occur, NatureServe formed part of a consortium of conservation organizations that joined forces to develop a digital library of the distributions of the birds and mammals of the Western Hemisphere. The goal of the project was to make these maps easily accessible to conservation planners and other interested users. The data presented here represents an updated version of major product of this collaborationa digital map library of the distributions of the birds of the Western Hemisphere, now covering 4,273 species. The maps are annotated to indicate sources, migratory status, historic versus current ranges, origin (native or introduced) and taxonomic decisions. The migratory status indications are particularly detailed, distinguishing where birds are permanent residents, breeding residents, non-breeding residents, or passage migrants. These maps are presented as a free resource for conservationists, researchers, and the general public. To view the map for each species, visit our InfoNatura website, search for the species you are interested in, and click on ""Range Map."" To download the map files in ArcView format, see below. The map files can be viewed using ESRI ArcExplorer software, which can be downloaded for free from ESRI's website.

In 2000, Foote Brook was identified as a high priority site for restoration after conducting an extensive countywide stream stability study. This project's reach is located in a transition area between a higher gradient channel upstream and a lower gradient pool-riffle system downstream. The study identified the upstream reach of Foote Brook as actively degrading, entrenched, with over-steepened streambanks. Downstream of Route 15, a channel avulsion threatened to form causing a significant reduction in stream length, increased stream slope, bank and bed erosion, and degraded fish habitat. The instability of the stream threatened Route 15 and its bridge, residential and commercial property, and a utility line. Foote Brook drains 8.49 square miles in the towns of Johnson and Belvedere, Vermont. The waterway rises at an elevation of 2650 feet above sea level and drops 485 feet to its confluence with the Lamoille River. Foote Brook has the highest population of trout for streams in Lamoille County. The channel is primarily a step-pool and plane-bed type system. Nearly the entire watershed is forested above the Route 15 crossing. Because of the well known problems of the river, Foote Brook was identified as a restoration implementation site to be funded as part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Project Impact Initiative. These data are part of a post-restoration monitoring phase in order to assess the success of the fairly new bioengineering techniques used in this project. In order to assess changes to the project area over a period of time, permanent photographic stations were established along the river. These photo stations are documented by Michael S. Adams of the Army Corps of Engineers on the site plans. Pre-restoration photos were taken by Mr. Adams prior to construction in 2001. These photos, titled 'Army Corps of Engineers Pre-Restoration Photo Inventory (2001) of the Foote Brooke in Johnson, VT' can be found zipped with this dataset. The first year of post-monitoring photos were taken on September 19 and 20, 2002 and the second year of post-monitoring photos were taken in September 29, 2003. These restoration photos are included in the 'Photo inventory of the Post-Monitoring (2002-2003) of the Foote Brook Natural Channel Design Restoration Project in Johnson, Vermont' zipped with this dataset (see Metadata Section 6 - Distribution for download information). Data results for the initial restoration project and the 2002 post monitoring are published in the spatial dataset titled 'Post Monitoring (2002) of the Foote Brook Natural Channel Design Restoration Project in Johnson, Vermont' (see Cross Reference for this metadata citation and information about data download). Prior to the implementation of this project, funding was secured to conduct aquatic insect pre and post restoration biomonitoring in order to monitor the health of the stream. These results are documented in Phase I and Phase 2 of the Foote Brook Macroinvertebrate Biomonitoring project (see Cross Reference for the metadata citation and information about data download). NOTE that this metadata was generated using the NBII Biological Profile and includes information about methods in Section 2 that will be lost if imported into a metadata software that doesn't recognize the biological fields (i.e. ArcCatalog).","Lamoille County Natural Resources Conservation District (LCNRCD)","","riffle-pool###channel Restoration###Lamoille County Planning Commission (LCPC)###hydrography###surface waters###riparian buffers###riverbed erosion###fisheries habitat###riverbank erosion###streambank restoration###riverbank Restoration###channel avulsion###Lamoille County Natural Resources Conservation District (LCNRCD)","http://www.vcgi.org/dataware/","Lamoille County###United States###VT###Lamoille River###Vermont###USA###Johnson###Foote Brook","","","","","",

A method of coal mining known as Longwall Mining has become more prevalent in recent decades. Longwall mining involves cutting the coal off the face of a long wall panel of coal in a single pass of the machinery. The machinery will then advance forward and perform another pass along the coal face. The broken off coal is hauled to the surface using conveyor belts. As the machinery advances forward into the coal panel, the mine roof is allowed to collapse behind it. This dataset identifies the footprint of these longwall panels relative to the surface.","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of District Mining Operations","Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of District Mining Operations","Redstone Coal Seam###longwall mining, Active mines###Middle Kittanning Coal Seam###Coal mines###Lower Freeport Coal Seam###Upper Freeport Coal Seam###economy###Bituminous coal###Abandoned mines###Clarion Coal Seam###Pittsburgh Coal Seam###longwall panel###Sewickley Coal Seam###Brookville Coal Seam###Waynesburg Coal Seam###Upper Kittanning Coal Seam###lower Kittanning Coal Seam","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

Media is the environmental resource that is associated with the cleanup effort. The following primary facility kinds describe the Acts from which cleanup locations are derived: Act2 Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards The first declaration of Section 102 of the policy provides a brief description of the purpose of Act2: The elimination of public health and environmental hazards on existing commercial and industrial land across this Commonwealth is vital to their use and reuse as sources of employment, housing, recreation, and open-space areas. The reuse of industrial land is an important component of a sound land use policy that will help prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open-space areas and natural areas and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure. CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding Evaluate damages to natural resources HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act [This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners. Other The Other primary facility kind includes a mixture of various different cleanup sites, no further action sites, and potential sites. This is optional data that the regional offices are not required to maintain. STSP Storage Tank Spill and Prevention Act Releases and/or ruptures from improperly installed or faulty storage tanks contaminate the Commonwealth's land and water resources.

The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.","PA Dept. of Environmental Protection","U.

After they move to this status, these products are no longer official and binding under the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program). However, Historic Products may serve as valuable reference information and provide a record of an area's changing flood risks over time. They are made available on the Map Service Center for these purposes. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) that were issued to amend Historic Products when they were still effective are also listed here. A LOMC is a formal document that communicates an official modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMCs are issued in place of a physical alteration and re-publication of the map. Regulatory Mapping Products Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - The official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. Full FIRM panels are quite large (36' x 25.875'), so most users will prefer to print out a smaller selected portion called a FIRMette. This can be accomplished by selecting ""View"" once you have located your FIRM or by using the FIRMette - Desktop application. Flood Insurance Study (FIS) - A compilation and presentation of flood risk data for specific watercourses, lakes and coastal flood hazard areas within a community. The FIS report provides a detailed written account of a flood hazard mapping study and its findings. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) - Documents, including different types of Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) and Letters of Map Amendment (LOMA), that are issued by FEMA to revise or amend the flood hazard information shown on the FIRM without requiring the FIRM to be physically revised and republished. In addition, FEMA issues a formal determination letter, called a LOMC Revalidation or LOMC-VALID letter - when one or more previously issued LOMCs are found to still be valid during a new flood mapping study of an area. Revalidation letters are included in the LOMC product results on this site.","Federal Emergency Management Agency","Federal Emergency Management Agency","hydrology###inlandWaters###structure###elevation###environment###transportation###FIRM###Coastal Flooding###Floodway###Special Flood Hazard Area###Base Flood Elevation###CBRS###Coastal Barrier Resources System###SFHA###Flood Insurance Rate Map###FIRM Database###NFIP###Riverine Flooding###FEMA Flood Hazard Zone","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

The reuse of industrial land is an important component of a sound land use policy that will help prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open-space areas and natural areas and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure. CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding Evaluate damages to natural resources HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act [This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners.

Biotransformation processes are potentially important in the restoration of aquifers contaminated with organic pollutants. As a result, these processes require evaluation in remedial action planning studies associated with hydrocarbon contaminants. It is based on the USGS solute transport code MOC and solves the solute transport equation six times to determine the fate and transport of the hydrocarbons and the electron acceptors (O2, NO3-, Fe3+, SO42-, and CO2) and the reaction by-products (Fe2+). A number of aerobic and anaerobic electron acceptors such as oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, iron (III) and carbon dioxide have been considered in this model to simulate the biodegradation of organic contaminants. Three different kinetic expressions can be used to simulate the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation reactions. These include: first-order decay, instantaneous reaction and Monod kinetics. The principal of superposition is used to combine the hydrocarbon plume with the electron acceptor plumes. The model has been integrated with a sophisticated ground-water modeling platform known as EIS. A graphical user platform allows the user to create, enter and edit data for model simulation. Discretization of time and space, hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer, initial and boundary conditions, sources and sinks, sorption, source decay, radioactive decay, ion-exchange and biodegradation variables are the different input parameters of the model. The model generates a standard output file that lists the results from a specific model run. This output file lists the input data for the run followed by computed head and concentration maps. Simulation results are also shown graphically. Data can be extracted and used in conjunction with a graphics generation software program to generate graphical results from the model.","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ground Water and Ecosystems Restoration Research","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ground Water and Ecosystems Restoration Research","organic contaminants###groundwater###natural attenuation###advection###dispersion###biodegradation###model###ground-water###sorption###finite difference model","","","","","","","",

This means that these waters contain significant portions that are open to public fishing and are stocked with trout. The waters in this layer are lakes (not flowing waters) classified as ""approved trout waters"" and these are open to trout harvest during the ""extended season"" (see Commonwealth Inland Waters). Unlisted tributary streams (those not included in this list of ""approved trout waters"") are not open to harvest of trout during the ""extended season."" Only approved trout waters and all waters downstream of approved trout waters are open during this period. Spearing fish is not permitted in any of these waters at any time of the year. These waters are closed to all fishing (including taking of minnows) from March 1 to 8 a.m. on the opening day of the trout season. Some of these waters have been included in the Early Season Trout-Stocked Waters Program and are open from March 1 through March 31. A person shall be deemed to be fishing if he or she has in possession any fishing line, rod, or other device that can be used for fishing while on or in any water or on the banks within 25 feet of any water where fishing is prohibited. Check with the nearest Fish & Boat Commission office if there is any question about whether or not a water area is ""approved."" This layer is current through the new fishing regulations released December of 2006 for the 2007 fishing season.","Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission","","Stocking###inlandWaters###Approved Trout Waters###Trout","http://www.pasda.psu.edu/","Pennsylvania","","","","","",

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage. The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage. This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground. The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most popular example of this configuration. Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS. Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes. While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations. Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is known as the flight deck. The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck. The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft. In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle. Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream. The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft. This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1. Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure. An aluminum flat plate i used to represent the aft deck. The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck. A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors show that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction. Additional scaling with the nozzle heights are also presented. The numerical simulations were performed using a fully viscous, hybrid RANS/LES model. They were set up to match the nozzle characteristics and run conditions performed in the experiment. A detailed comparison between the unsteady pressures predicted by the computational simulations and that measured by the experiment is presented. Several discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are the result of numerical error caused by the time marching scheme used in the simulations. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is introduced to further analyze the computational simulations and provide a filtering method to obtain more accurate results.
