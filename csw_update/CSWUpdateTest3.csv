Permanently preserved agricultural lands are parcels subject to some type of preservation easement as well as properties owned by federal, state and local governments. In addition, properties owned by local trusts and private conservation organizations such as The Nature Conservancy are included. Conservation easements include easements from the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF), Rural Legacy, Forest Legacy, Maryland Environmental Trust (MET), county and state purchases of development rights, transfers of development rights, open space from home owners associations, local open space requirements, and private conservation easements. This data is compiled from settlement data directly from conservation program administrators, county GIS updates on preservation activities, and publicly available data from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. In addition, this data is in the process of being realigned to the 2012 MD iMap parcel polygons. The realignments are available on a county by county basis depending on the production schedule.",Maryland###MDP###MALPF###Agriculture###WMS###Rural Legacy###WFS###Maryland Department of Planning###easement###MET###Vector###preservation###AGRL###conservation###Dynamic###protected lands###MD iMAP###MD,-79.4871###-75.2327###38.0044###39.7226,"The Spatial Data, and the information therein, (collectively the Data is provided as is without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory.
